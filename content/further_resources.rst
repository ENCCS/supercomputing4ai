Further resources
====================

While we have mainly looked at the "classic" way to login and interact with the cluster,
newer systems have other GUI-based interfaces that you can use. For example:

* Dardel can use `Thinlinc <https://www.pdc.kth.se/support/documents/login/interactive_hpc.html>`__, 
  which gives you a remote desktop on the cluster with the possibility to book nodes and launch apps
  directly there.
* `LUMI <https://lumi-supercomputer.eu>`__ has a `web interface <https://www.lumi.csc.fi>`__ with a 
  dashboard to launch common applications such as VS Code, Jupyter, Jupyter Julia. Each app has a launcher
  to book resources and run it on a compute node, with or without GPU.

In general, it is also possible to use Jupyter on any HPC resource with plain SSH,
as detailed in our `tutorial <https://enccs.se/tutorials/2024/05/jupyter-notebooks-on-a-supercomputer/>`__.
